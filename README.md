**PROXIMAL INTERACTING PARTICLE LANGEVIN ALGORITHMS**

Repository with Proximal Interacting Particle Langevin Algorithms, to perform learning and inference in latent variable models with non-differentiable target.


**Description**

This repository contains code illustrating the application of the different proximal interacting particle Langevin algorithms. 
We show the performance of our methods in a toy hierarchical model, a Bayesian logistic regression problem with sparsity inducing prior, a BNN classifier in MNIST data with a Laplace prior on the weights and a finally a matrix completion problem.
